# RPG-maker-MV-plugins
An unified repository for my RMMV plugins. 

# Plugin list  
Asset encrypter - encrypts your game assets using a basic, generic algorithm  
Asset decoder - decodes the assets for your game
Database encoder - encodes your files inside /data folder using Base64 encoding to make sure they're not human readable.  
Database decoder - decodes files encoded by Database encoder  
Input blocker - blocks all input movement upon turning on a switch. Input blocker for both keyboard and mouse, InputBlockerKM allows you to choose whether one or the other or both.  
Message input blocker - blocks all input inside a message window. In test mode you have an emergency key - Shift.  
Fixed leader - cosmetic plugin working only with no followers. Your map "leader" will work the same on map regardless of your party leader.  
Extra event pages - allows you to add extra event pages from an event on a dummy map to an event on a real map, allowing you to effectively exceed the 20 event pages per event. Also, you can freely mix together a couple of events and even create event variations based on the event pages you copy.  
Event spawner - Requires the Extra event pages plugin. Spawns events. Unlike GALV's event spawner however, this plugin directly influences $dataMap and serves more as an utility plugin to streamline events addition and edit. Also allows you to save the final version of $dataMap into the data map file with both a notetag and a plugin command.  
Extended text manager - a plugin that allows you to customize the terms midgame or create completely new custom terms.  
Auto skip message - a plugin that automatically skips game messages after certain time based on characters, spaces or just  
flat time you set.  
Scrolling pictures - Scroll pictures using scroll wheel as long as they're wider or higher than respective screen dimensions. Dir2 means the y axis scrolling is inverted.  
Scrolling pictures compatibility patch - compatibility patch with MRP_MessageHideOnRightClick plugin. Now the image only scrolls if the message window is hidden. Works only on map.
